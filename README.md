### <font color=red>***An easy way to become a githuber***</font>üòÉ<br>
if you are the one who is ignorant of how to use github and git to become a developer,<br>
i would recommend you to have a try on this website: [***a goood github learning leader***](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=zh_CN "I think it is the best tutorial website"),<br>
and for some unavoidable reasons (is about the website itslef, the author said.)<br>
you will need this website as a supplement ``merge commit``: [***tutorial website of merge commit***](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/139321091 "I take it randomly on search engine, though")üòä<br>
